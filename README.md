ShareMiiShot is a web service designed for Wii U for sharing images between consoles and devices such as phones or PCs. 


# Warning
Due to the Wii U's hardware limitations, this service does not guarantee clear image sharing; images will lose quality. (To ensure the service works, some quality must be sacrificed.)
