# ShareMiiShot
ShareMiiShot is a web service designed for Wii U/3DS for sharing images between consoles and devices such as phones or PCs. 

# How it work

 It's very simple! 
 
1. Download the Python code (main.py) and run it via an IDE (such as VSCode for PC and Pydroid for Android).
2. Agree to start a local server on port :8080 (for security reasons, the server will shut down after 5 minutes).
3. Open (the site)[https://madebyanto.github.io/sharemiishot] on the Wii U/3DS and Select the image.
4. Click "Send to Wi-Fi Server" and wait a few seconds.
5. You should receive the image. The Python code should appear, and you'll be given the option to download it.
6. You've transferred the image; enjoy!

# Notes

> The transfer speed varies depending on your connection, but even on slow connections the service will work quite well (A connection with 1Mbps is quite good)

> The Wii U/3DS browser is complicated, as it uses older technology. Expect new updates to the web app to cause minor issues with the service.

> On the Wii U/3DS browser, when you enter the site, 99% of the time it will give you a certificate error. Skip it without hesitation.
