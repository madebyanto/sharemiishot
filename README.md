# ShareMiiShot
ShareMiiShot is a web service for Wii U and 3DS that lets you share images between consoles and devices like phones or PCs.

# How it works

It’s super simple!  

1. Download the Python code (`main.py`) and run it using an IDE (e.g., VSCode on PC or Pydroid on Android).  
2. Agree to start a local server on port `:8080`. For security reasons, the server will automatically shut down after 5 minutes.  
3. On your Wii U/3DS, open the [ShareMiiShot website](http://sharemiishot.aurastudioitalia.it) and select the image you want to send.  
4. Click **"Send to Wi-Fi Server"** and wait a few seconds.  
5. The image will be transferred and appear in the Python code, where you can download it.  
6. That’s it! Your image has been successfully transferred.  

# Notes

> Transfer speed depends on your connection, but the service works well even on slower connections. A 1 Mbps connection is sufficient.  

> The Wii U/3DS browser is a bit outdated, so some minor issues may occur after web app updates.
